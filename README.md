# dot-emacs-dot-d

This is my Emacs Configuration File. Initially I wrote everything on an emacs init file. I did not write everything you see here from scratch, I adapted this one from [harry's](https://harryrschwartz.com/ "harry swartz") and [aaron's](https://aaronbieber.com/ "aaron's")  configuration files. 

Then I wrote a second iteration in org mode.

Then I switched to doom emacs :)
