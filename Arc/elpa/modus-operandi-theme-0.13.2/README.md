# Modus themes (Modus Operandi and Modus Vivendi)

A pair of highly accessible themes that conform with the WCAG AAA
standard for colour contrast between background and foreground colour
combinations.

The themes are currently built into GNU Emacs (Emacs' git `master`
branch, aka version `28.0.50`).  They are also distributed in several
packages formats (see next section).

+ 'modus-operandi' is light
+ 'modus-vivendi' is dark

## Further information

Read the [Info manual HTML](https://protesilaos.com/modus-themes)
version for how to install, load, enable, and customise the themes.

If you are using the latest version of the themes from this repository's
`master` branch (e.g. the MELPA packages), the manual is already
installed on your machine: evaluate `(info "(modus-themes) Top")` to
start reading it.  All other packages, including upstream Emacs, will
get it in version `0.13.0` at the end of September 2020.

The themes cover a lot of packages and are highly customisable.
